Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), 
and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.

--CREATE a table to store the data.

CREATE TABLE pacman_scores (id INTEGER, name TEXT, score INTEGER);

--INSERT a few example rows in the table.

INSERT INTO pacman_scores VALUES (1, 'courtney', 1000);
INSERT INTO pacman_scores VALUES (2, 'shawn', 750);
INSERT INTO pacman_scores VALUES (3, 'shawn', 500);

SELECT * FROM pacman_scores;

--Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.


UPDATE pacman_scores SET score = 3000 WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM pacman_scores;

--Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

DELETE FROM pacman_scores WHERE name = 'shawn';

SELECT * FROM pacman_scores;
